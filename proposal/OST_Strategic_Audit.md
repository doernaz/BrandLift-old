## 4. Revenue Model: "Left on the Table"
We calculated the monthly revenue potential you are missing by not ranking in the Top 3 positions.

**Formula:**
$$ \text{Revenue Gap} = (\text{Total Search Volume} \times \text{CTR Gap}) \times \text{Conv. Rate} \times \text{AOV} $$

**Inputs:**
*   **Total Monthly Search Volume:** 5,400 (Local Semantic Reach)
*   **CTR Gap (Pos 10 vs Pos 1):** 20% (Conservative)
*   **Client Conversion Rate:** 3.5% (Industry Standard)
*   **Average Order Value (LTV):** $850

**Calculation:**
$$ (5,400 \times 0.20) \times 0.035 \times \$850 = \mathbf{\$32,130} $$
